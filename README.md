Disclaimer: I completed this project as part of my Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. CSS and HTML were provided.

## About
This project creates a browser-based, word guessing game: `Phrase Hunter.' Using JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming, it selects a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen or physical keyboard.  The first image shows initial state of a new game, while the second shows a partially completed game. The hearts at the bottom indicate how many incorrect attempts a player has before losing.
