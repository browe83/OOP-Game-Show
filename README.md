# OOP-Game-Show-Project-4

JavaScript by Brandon Rowe

Thanks so much for looking at my project!

I am going for exceeds expectations. As a result:

1. An event listener has been added for the keydown event so that pressing a physical keyboard button results in the handleInteraction() method being called for the associated onscreen keyboard button.

2. The app styles have been personalized: The original colors for #overlay, .title and .start have been commented out and replaced with yellow or green.

Thanks again for your time and expertise.

Best,
Brandon
